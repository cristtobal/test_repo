"7582","1990-10-31","X-Ray Laser Never 'Star' of 'Star Wars'  To the Editor:   Contrary to your report that Congress has dealt a near-fatal blow to the ""star"" of ""Star Wars"" (news article, Oct. 21), the X-ray laser has never been the ""star"" of what became the Strategic Defense Initiative. While Dr. Edward Teller was enthusiastic about this device, he principally interested some advocates of missile defenses in nonnuclear, antimissile lasers.   As early as the fall of 1981, the X-ray laser was denounced by members of the High Frontier panel, an unofficial group that studied strategic defenses and reported its findings to President Reagan in January 1982. Furthermore, the X-ray laser was also rejected by Adm. James D. Watkins, Chief of Naval Operations. He played a key role in convincing the Joint Chiefs unanimously to recommend a new strategic defense program to the President about six weeks before Mr. Reagan's S.D.I. speech in March 1983.   Nor has the X-ray laser been of major significance in the program developed by the S.D.I. organization beginning in early 1984. Its 1985 report to Congress stated that nuclear-driven directed-energy weapons were being pursued as a hedge against Soviet development of such devices.    The report reiterated that the program was emphasizing nonnuclear weapons for defense. In its April 1987 report to Congress, the S.D.I. organization stated that the ""primary candidate for the space-based laser concept uses chemical lasers fueled with hydrogen-fluoride."" The 1989 report continued to show that the nuclear-directed energy program was of only minor importance.   The 1989 report also announced progress on a new concept, Brilliant Pebbles (a small, autonomous hit-to-kill interceptor missile). The report noted that this new missile might become the basis for ""a highly effective first defense layer."" If there ever has been an S.D.I. ""star,"" that role has been played for two years by Brilliant Pebbles.   It is too simple to speak of any one technology as a ""star"" of ""Star Wars."" S.D.I. has pursued a balanced program that includes developments with promise for near-term deployment and more advanced technologies that might enhance a strategic defense in the more distant future should the nation decide to field such a system. DONALD R. BAUCOM Alexandria, Va., Oct. 21, 1990   The writer, who retired from the Air Force, was historian for the Strategic Defense Initiative organization.  ",0.0604651162790698
